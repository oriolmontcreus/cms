For context im building a CMS made with Sveltekit, Mongodb and HonoJs (Monorepo).
Note that the current purpouse its to create something similar to Filament V3 (yes that tool made with PHP.)
For components we always use shadcn-svelte (lastest version). Most components are already installed in the project.
For both backend and frontend never use try and catches. Both my backend and frontend already have wrappers that catch all errors.
